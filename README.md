Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a technique used in text mining. It may, therefore, be described as a text mining technique for analyzing the underlying sentiment of a text message, i.e., a tweet. Twitter sentiment or opinion expressed through it may be positive, negative or neutral. However, no algorithm can give you 100% accuracy or prediction on sentiment analysis.

<br> Importing  Python Modules:
<br>textblob 
<br>sys 
<br>tweepy 
<br>matplotlib.pyplot 
<br>pandas 
<br>numpy 
<br>PIL 
<br>wordcloud
